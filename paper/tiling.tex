We shall now present a representation of the problem which will greatly simplify the analysis of $v$ and $h$ collisions for some ball $b$, called the tiling representation.

To understand the basics of how it works, imagine placing a square billiards table on the $xy$ plane. The billiards table (as mentioned in the introduction) will be a unit square, so it will contain $[0,1]^2$. The table's edges will be the four line segments bordering the unit square. Now imagine creating four copies of the original table by reflecting the original square across each of the sides. There will now be five tables in total in the $xy$ plane.
