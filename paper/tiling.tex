We shall now present a representation of the problem which will greatly simplify the analysis of $v$ and $h$ collisions for some ball $b$, called the tiling representation. First we will define some basic definitions we need to explain the tiling representation.

\begin{definition}
  A billiard ball \emph{trajectory} $\tau(t_0, t_1)$ is the curved traced by a billiard ball $b$ between times $t_0$ and $t_1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A collision time $\kappa_i$ for a billiard ball $b$ is the time at which the $i$th collision occurs.
\end{definition}

To understand the basics of how the tiling representation works, imagine placing a square billiard table on the $xy$ plane. The billiard table (as mentioned in the introduction) will be a unit square, so it will contain $[0,1]^2$. The table's edges will be the four line segments bordering the unit square. A ball will start with some initial position $\bvec{x}_0 \in [0,1]^2$ and velocity $\bvec{v}_0$. After some time, the ball will collide with an edge $e_0$ of the table. However, instead of thinking of the trajectory of the ball as being reflected across the line perpendicular to $e$ at the point of collision, we will instead reflect the original unit square $s_0$ across the edge $e_0$ to create a new square $s_1$. Now, the trajectory of the ball after the first collision will be presented in the new square $s_1$.

In other words, the trajectory of $b$ before the first collision will be confined to the original square $s_0$, and the trajectory after the first collision will be confined to the new reflected square $s_1$. We can continue the process for each new collision. Suppose the ball collides with edge $e_1$ in square $s_1$. Then, we shall create a new square $s_2$ which is a reflection of square $s_1$ across the edge $e_1$. The trajectory of the ball $b$ after the second collision will be confined to the newest reflected square $s_2$. This process will continue on indefinitely.

Figure \ref{fig:tiling} shows an example trajectory which is created using this tiling process. In essence, the tiling representation reflects a table about each of its four sides. These reflections will perform the same process, eventually tiling and completely filling the $xy$ plane. The trajectory of particular billiard ball can then be traced through the tiling in the $xy$-plane, as seen in figure \ref{fig:tiling}.

Notice that there are a couple of things:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Trajectory maps out a straight line in the tiling representation
  \item $v$ collisions happen exactly when the trajectory intersects a vertical line. Same for $h$ collisions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
  The trajectory of a billiard ball is a ray in the $xy$ plane under the tiling representation.
\end{theorem}
