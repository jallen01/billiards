Finally, we will show how collision sequences relate to continued fractions. Recall that a continued fraction is an expression of any real number as a sum of an integer part and the reciprical of another number. For example, $r \in \mathrm{R}$ can be represented as follows:

\begin{eqnarray}
r = k_1 + \frac{1}{k_2 + \frac{1}{k_3 + \cdots}} \\
\end{eqnarray}

Integers $k_1, k_2, \ldots$ are called quotients of the continued fraction. A real number $r$ can be expressed in its continued fraction form $r = [k_1, k_2, k_3, \ldots]$. The quotient $k_i$ is found by taking the reciprocal of the fractional part of $k_{i-1}$ (setting $k_0 = r$).

If use the continued fraction representation for the slope $m$ of a combined trajectory for a billiard ball, then we have:

\begin{eqnarray}
m = \lfloor m \rfloor + \frac{1}{\lfloor 1 / \{m\} \rfloor + \frac{1}{\lfloor 1/\{1/\{m\}\} \rfloor + \cdots}}
\end{eqnarray}

Where the quotients are given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
  k_1 &=& \left\lfloor m \right\rfloor \\
  k_2 &=& \left\lfloor \frac{1}{\{m\}} \right\rfloor \\
  k_3 &=& \left\lfloor \frac{1}{\left\{ \frac{1}{\{m\}} \right\}} \right\rfloor \\
  k_4 &=& \left\lfloor \frac{1}{\left\{ \frac{1}{\left\{\frac{1}{\{m\}}\right\}} \right\}} \right\rfloor \\
      &\vdots& \\
\end{eqnarray}

We see that the quotients are given by the recursive formula: $k_j = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{m - [k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{j-1}]} \right\rfloor$. In fact, a more interesting observation is that the sequence of quotients $k_j$ form exactly the sequence of the minimum number of tick marks in each $\beta^{(j)}$ subproblem:

\begin{theorem}
  Given the continued fraction representation $m = [k_1, k_2, k_3, \ldots]$ for the slope $m \in \mathrm{R}$ of the combined trajectory $T$ of a billiard ball, we must have $k_j = \beta_{min}^{(j)}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We will proceed by induction. This is clearly true for $k_1 = \lfloor m \rfloor$ by lemma \ref{lem:interval-ticks}, since for $\beta_{min}^{(j)}$ the spacing of the larger tick marks are $m$ and the spacing of the smaller tick marks is $1$.

  Now suppose we have shown our hypothesis to be true for all $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{j-1}$. This means that $\beta_{min}^{(i)} = k_{i}$ for all $i \leq j-1$. By definition \ref{def:beta-definition} (of the sequence $\beta^{(j)}$), we see that $\beta_i^{(j)}$ is one more than the number of occurrences of $\beta^{(j-1)}_{max}$ between the $i$th and $(i+1)$st occurrence of $\beta^{(j-1)}_{min}$ in the $\beta^{(j-1)}$ sequence.

  Now, we can find an expression for $k_{j}$ based on our definition of continued fractions:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    k_j &=& \left\lfloor \frac{1}{m - [k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{j-1}]} \right\rfloor \\
        &=& \left\lfloor \frac{1}{m - [\beta_{min}^{(1)}, \beta_{min}^{(2)}, \ldots, \beta_{min}^{(j-1)}]} \right\rfloor
  \end{eqnarray}

  However, notice that $d = m - [\beta_{min}^{(1)}, \ldots, \beta_{min}^{(j-1)}]$ is equal to the spacing between tick marks in the $\beta^{(j)}$ sequence. Thus, we see that $\beta_{min}^{(j)} = \lfloor 1/d \rfloor$. However, this is exactly what we wanted to show, since we know that $k_j = \floor 1/d \rfloor$, so we see that $\beta_{min}^{(j)} = k_j$.
\end{proof}

In fact, one can see that the process of finding $\beta^{(j)}_i$ for the $\beta^{(j)}$ subproblems exactly mirrors the process of finding the quotients $k_j$ in a continued fraction of $m$.
