In this paper we explored properties of valid billiard ball collision sequences. We introduced a useful tiling representation that drastically simplified the problem and allowed us to easily characterize all valid collision sequences. From the tiling representation, we developed a series of ``meta'' problems in the same manner as one calculates a continued fraction expansion. We also showed an interesting way to visualize the original problem and the ``meta'' problems as 1-dimensional problems on a number line.
