\subsection*{Abstract}

In this paper we explore properties of sequences of billiard ball collisions. We present a tiling representation which is used to help elucidate some simple properties of these sequences. Then, we provide a one-dimensional representation which builds upon the tiling representation. Next, we provide a method which takes an arbitrary sequence and checks to see if it could have been created by a billiard ball colliding with a billiard table. Finally, we show how these sequences relate to continued fractions.
