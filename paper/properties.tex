We will now use the tiling representation that we have developed to discover properties of collision sequences. The first simple property is that collision sequences are periodic when the initial conditions are rational numbers. Now that we can define a billiard ball as a line, instead of giving initial conditions $\bvec{x}_0$ and $\bvec{v}_0$, we can give the slope $m$ and the $y$-intercept $y_0$ of the complete trajectory's line.

\begin{theorem}
  There exists a $k \in \mathrm{N}$ such that $mk + y_0 \equiv y_0 \pmod{2}$ if and only if $m \in \mathrm{Q}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
